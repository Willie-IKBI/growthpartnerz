### 1. **Install Dependencies**
If you havenâ€™t already, install all required packages:
```sh
npm install
```
or, if you use yarn:
```sh
yarn install
```

---

### 2. **Start the Development Server**
Run the following command in your project root:
```sh
npm run dev
```
or, with yarn:
```sh
yarn dev
```

---

### 3. **Open in Your Browser**
Once the server is running, open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```
You should see your Growth Partnerz homepage.

**Tip:**  
- If you made changes to the folder structure (e.g., using `/src/app/(marketing)/page.tsx`), make sure your Next.js app is set up to use the app directory (which it is, by default, in Next.js 13+).
- If you get any errors, check the terminal output for missing dependencies or typos in imports.

Let me know if you need help with any errors or want to deploy the site!
